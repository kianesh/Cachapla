# Cachapla 

This repository contains custom code for widgets and features used in the development of [Cachapla.com](https://cachapla.com), a WordPress-based website for the **Cachapla Collective** music brand.

## üìå Features Overview


### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Custom Gradient Mesh and Interactive Dropdown Menu
A custom **gradient mesh background** was integrated using [whatamesh.vercel](https://whatamesh.vercel.app/). Implement this yourself by going to the website, customizing your gradient, downloading the Gradient.js file and adding it somewhere into your project (for those on WordPress navigate to the js folder under your theme in the File Manager).

The dropdown menu was also a requested custom feature that changes state on hover. All features can be seen in the screenshots attached.
