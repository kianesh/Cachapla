<!--
Go to https://whatamesh.vercel.app/ to customize your own gradient mesh. 

For this to work, you must make a Gradient.js file somewhere in your project, the code for which is provided in the WhatAMesh website. 

For those working on WordPress, go to your file manager and create Gradient.js under the js folder of your theme (I put it in the unminified for simplicity).

<canvas id="gradient-canvas"></canvas>
<script type="module">
    import { Gradient } from 'https://cachapla.com/wp-content/themes/astra/assets/js/unminified/Gradient.js'; // This client's website is developed on a hosting service using WordPress 

    const gradient = new Gradient();
    gradient.initGradient('#gradient-canvas');
</script>


<style>
    #gradient-canvas {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100vh; /* Adjust as needed */
    display: block;
    --gradient-color-1: #233b63; 
  --gradient-color-2: #bd9675; 
  --gradient-color-3: #43616f;  
  --gradient-color-4: #8e7e73;
}

</style>
